# Smart Mailbox Solution – La Poste Tunisienne

**📍 Internship | La Poste Tunisienne**  
**🗓️ February 2022 – May 2022 (4 months)**  
**🌍 Tunis, Tunisia (Hybrid)**  

This project was developed during my end-of-studies internship at *La Poste Tunisienne*. The goal was to create a **Smart Mailbox System** that enhances mail distribution efficiency and reduces the need for manual mailbox checks by postal workers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Smart Mailbox Solution is composed of three main components:

1. **Hardware System**  
   - Built using a **Raspberry Pi 4 B** board  
   - Integrated with **motion and infrared sensors**  
   - Programmed using **Python**, with **Linux** as the operating system  
   - Automation and logic control handled through **Node-RED**

2. **Admin Web Dashboard**  
   - Built with **React.js**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**  
   - Backend powered by **MySQL**  
   - Enables administrators to monitor mail distribution in real-time

3. **User Mobile Application**  
   - Developed using **Flutter** in **Android Studio**  
   - Sends real-time notifications to users when new parcels arrive

4. **System Integration**  
   - All components are linked via the **MQTT protocol**  
   - Used **HiveMQ** as the broker to enable real-time communication and notifications
